> This repository is a curated collection of beginner-friendly frontend projects built purely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The primary goal is to demonstrate a solid understanding of web fundamentals like **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **state management** before advancing to modern frameworks.

## Project Showcase

Each project is a self-contained module designed to tackle a specific challenge and reinforce key concepts.

| Project | Core Functionality | Key Concepts Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Distance Converter** | Converts units bidirectionally (e.g., kilometers ↔ miles). | `input` event listeners, number coercion, basic math operations. |
| **2. Digital Clock** | Displays the current time, auto-refreshing every second. | JavaScript `Date` object, `setInterval()`, and conditional rendering. |
| **3. Color Changer** | Generates a random hex color and applies it to the background. | Random number generation, string interpolation, and `style.backgroundColor`. |
| **4. To-Do List** | A stateful task manager with add, remove, and complete features. | Dynamic element creation (`createElement`), event delegation, `localStorage`. |
| **5. Calculator** | A functional calculator for basic arithmetic operations. | UI state management, operator precedence logic, and algorithm design. |

## Tech Stack

This portfolio exclusively uses the "vanilla" stack to focus on the core technologies that power the web.

* **HTML5**: Used for creating a semantic and accessible structure for each application.
* **CSS3**: Applied for styling, layout (including Flexbox/Grid), and basic responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers all the logic, interactivity, and DOM manipulation.

## Getting Started

To explore these projects locally on your machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name/project-folder-name
    ```

3.  **Run the Project**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No compilers or servers are needed!

## Future Roadmap

This portfolio is a living project. Future plans include:

* **Refactor**: Abstract common functionalities into reusable JavaScript modules.
* **Testing**: Implement unit tests for the Calculator and Converter logic using a framework like Jest.
* **Framework Migration**: Rebuild a project in React to compare vanilla JS with component-based architecture.
* **Deployment**: Host the projects live using GitHub Pages for easy public access.
